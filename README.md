## üíª Technology Used

- **[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)** is the biggest framework on top of **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** to generate *SPA* and *universal* SPAs. Since this webapp doesn't have much of static information, I don't need to index the content on Google and I need access to localStorage, I'm using the SPA mode. **You can read more about the differences between static and SPA [in this article I wrote](https://marinaaisa.com/blog/cook-websites-based-on-your-needs).**

- **[Nuxt-i18n](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n)** as a Nuxt's pluging on top of [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) for i18n features.

- **[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)** as state management library.

- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** and **[Vue Tests Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/)** as testing frameworks and utils.

- **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)** as CSS preprocessor.

- **[LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)** to save user's tasks in their browser and restore data when page is reload.

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** to format the code.

- **[Netlify](https://eslint.org/)** for deployment.

## üîç Web Accessibility:
For checking web accessibility you can use [this advance tool for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc).
